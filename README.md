##  Overview

Literary Lens is a modern, responsive blog homepage designed to provide readers with an engaging experience while exploring articles, categories, and updates. The site balances **aesthetic design** with **usability**, focusing on accessibility, readability, and interactivity.

## Design Approaches

### 1. **Visual Identity & Branding**

* A warm **color palette** (earthy browns, muted pinks, cream tones) conveys a literary and cozy aesthetic.
* Consistent use of **CSS variables** makes theme management easy (light/dark mode support).
* Typography is clean and professional, ensuring readability across all sections.


### 2. **Layout & Structure**

* Built with a **grid-based layout** for the hero section, blog posts grid, and footer.
* The site follows a **two-column layout** in the main content area:

  * **Left:** Blog posts grid
  * **Right:** Sidebar with categories, recent posts, search, and social links
* Sticky elements like the **navigation bar** and **sidebar widgets** improve navigation and accessibility.

### 3. **Navigation & Usability**

* **Sticky navigation bar** with smooth scrolling for section links.
* **Responsive mobile menu toggle** ensures seamless browsing on smaller devices.
* **Interactive search bar** in the header and sidebar for better content discovery.
* **Category filters** let users quickly filter posts by type (Technology, Reviews, Writing Tips, etc.).

### 4. **Content Presentation**

* **Hero section** highlights the featured post with a bold title, excerpt, and visual.
* **Post cards** use hover animations, thumbnails, and metadata for scannable reading.
* Sidebar widgets (categories, recent posts, search, social links) provide easy access to secondary content.

### 5. **Interactivity & Engagement**

* **Read More buttons** with icons guide readers deeper into content.
* **Theme toggle (Light/Dark mode)** improves accessibility and user personalization.

### 6. **Footer Design**

* Consistent use of branding, links, and social media icons for extended engagement.
* Footer bottom includes copyright.

### 7. **Responsiveness & Accessibility**

* **Media queries** adapt the layout for tablets and mobile devices.
* Mobile-first adjustments:

  * Posts grid changes to single-column.
